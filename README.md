Lightweight ad hoc Q&A board, designed for lecturing.

As a lecturer:
 * pick an identifier for your lecture, say "mycourse42".
 * navigate to http://postit.itu.dk/mycourse42/view
 * this creates a new board (if it is not already there), and displays the lecturing view, encouraging students to navigate to http://postit.itu.dk/mycourse42 to ask questions.
